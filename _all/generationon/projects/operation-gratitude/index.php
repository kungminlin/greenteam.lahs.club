						<h1>What did we do?</h1>
						<p>generationOn LAHS held letter drives for American veterans and deployed troops through Operation Gratitude. We were able to work with four different schools: Los Altos High School, Bubb Elementary School, Crittenden Middle School, and Gardner Bullis, where we set up collection boxes and provided teachers with letter-writing resources and guidelines. </p>
		        <br />
		        <p>Within the club, members made paracord bracelets and wrote letters  for the veterans and deployed troops. </p>

						<h1>Why did we do it?</h1>
						<p>We decided to start this project in honor of Veterans Day. Inspired by the candy drives for troops at our elementary schools, we wanted to give back to those who have served our country. Through the project, we hoped not only to help our troops and veterans, but to also give local students the opportunity to give back to others..</p>

						<h1>Reflection</h1>
						<p>We were so grateful for how well-received our project was. Despite being a completely new, unknown club with no track record, our local schools took a leap of faith and aided us in our efforts to bring a little love into the lives of deployed troops and veterans. Thanks to the wonderful contributions from students and staff alike, we were able to send a total of 329 letters to Operation Gratitude. In addition, thanks to a grant from the PTSA, we were able to purchase the supplies for our collection drive as well as the paracord for the bracelets for the troops. </p>
		        <br />
		        <p>We did encounter some unforeseen obstacles that made the project stretch out much longer than intended, including having the letters locked in a teacherâ€™s classroom over break, members not turning in the letters on time, and complications with shipments. However, we are very proud of the end result and intend to do this project again next year. </p>
		        <br />
		        <p>We would again like to thank the local community for its support of our project. The students wrote the most heartwarming things, and we are certain that the deployed troops and veterans will love it.</p>
