											Los Altos Hacks III
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://losaltoshacks.com">Los Altos Hacks</a> is a hackathon organized completely independently by Los Altos High School students. This year, the LAHS Green Team wanted to explore technological alternatives in solving environmental issues. In order to provide student hackers with an incentive to produce applications regarding environmentalism, the LAHS Green Team sponsored a "best environmental hack" category prize. More than 10 teams applied for the prize and many interesting solutions were presented in the hackathon.</p>
